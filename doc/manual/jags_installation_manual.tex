\title{JAGS Version \release\ installation manual}
\author{Martyn Plummer \and Bill Northcott}
\maketitle

\JAGS\ is distributed in binary format for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS
X, and most Linux distributions.  The following instructions are for
those who wish to build \JAGS\ from source. The manual is divided
into three sections with instructions for Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows.

\section{Linux and UNIX}

\JAGS\ follows the usual GNU convention of 
\begin{verbatim}
./configure
make
make install
\end{verbatim}
which is described in more detail in the file \texttt{INSTALL} in
the top-level source directory. On some UNIX platforms, you may
be required to use GNU make (gmake) instead of the native make
command. On systems with multiple processors, you may use the option 
\option{-j} to speed up compilation, {\em e.g.} for a quad-core PC you
may use:
\begin{verbatim}
make -j4
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Configure options}

At configure time you also have the option of defining options such
as:
\begin{itemize}
\item The names of the C, C++, and Fortran compilers.  
\item Optimization flags for the compilers.  \JAGS\ is optimized by
  default if the GNU compiler (gcc) is used. If you are using another
  compiler then you may need to explicitly supply optimization flags.
\item Installation directories. \JAGS\ conforms to the GNU standards
  for where files are installed. You can control the installation
  directories in more detail using the flags that are listed when
  you type \command{./configure --help}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configuration for a 64-bit build}

By default, JAGS will install all libraries into
\file{/usr/local/lib}.  If you are building a 64-bit version of \JAGS,
this may not be appropriate for your system. On Fedora and other
RPM-based distributions, for example, 64-bit libraries should be
installed in \file{lib64}, and on Solaris, 64-bit libraries are in a
subdirectory of \file{lib} ({\em e.g.} \file{lib/amd64} if you are
using a x86-64 processor), whereas on Debian, and other Linux
distributions that conform to the FHS, the correct installation
directory is \file{lib}.

To ensure that \JAGS\ libraries are installed in the correct
directory, you should supply the \option{--libdir} argument to the
configure script, {\em e.g.}:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib64
\end{verbatim}

It is important to get the installation directory right when using the
\texttt{rjags} interface between R and \JAGS, otherwise the
\texttt{rjags} package will not be able to find the \JAGS\ library.

\subsubsection{Configuration for a private installation}

If you do not have administrative privileges, you may wish to install
\JAGS\ in your home directory. This can be done with the following
configuration options
\begin{verbatim}
export JAGS_HOME=$HOME/jags #or wherever you want it
./configure --prefix=$JAGS_HOME
\end{verbatim}
For more detailed control over the installation directories type
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --help
\end{verbatim}
and read the section ``Fine-tuning of the installation directories.''

With a private installation, you need to modify your PATH environment
variable to include \file{\$JAGS\_HOME/bin}. You may also need to set
\code{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} to include \file{\$JAGS\_HOME/lib} (On Linux this
is not necessary as the location of libjags and libjrmath is hard-coded
into the \JAGS\ binary).

\subsection{BLAS and LAPACK}
\label{section:blas:lapack}

BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Pack)
are two libraries of routines for linear algebra. They are used by the
multivariate functions and distributions in the \texttt{bugs} module.
Most unix-like operating system vendors supply shared libraries that
provide the BLAS and LAPACK functions, although the libraries may not
literally be called ``blas'' and ``lapack''.  During configuration, a
default list of these libraries will be checked. If \texttt{configure}
cannot find a suitable library, it will stop with an error message.

You may use alternative BLAS and LAPACK libraries using the configure
options \texttt{--with-blas} and \texttt{--with-lapack}
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --with-blas="-lmyblas" --with-lapack="-lmylapack"
\end{verbatim}

If the BLAS and LAPACK libraries are in a directory that is not on the
default linker path, you must set the \code{LDFLAGS} environment variable
to point to this directory at configure time:
\begin{verbatim}
LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/my/libs" ./configure ...
\end{verbatim}

At runtime, if you have linked \JAGS\ against BLAS or LAPACK in
a non-standard location, you must supply this location with the
environment variable \code{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}, {\em e.g.}
\begin{verbatim}
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/my/libs:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
\end{verbatim} %$
Alternatively, you may hard-code the paths to the blas and lapack
libraries at compile time. This is compiler and platform-specific,
but is typically achieved with
\begin{verbatim}
LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/my/libs -R/path/to/my/libs
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Multithreaded BLAS and LAPACK}
\label{section:blas:multithreaded}

Some high-performance computing libraries offer multi-threaded
versions of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Although instructions for
linking against some of these libraries are given below, this should
not be taken as encouragement to use multithreaded BLAS.  Testing
shows that using multiple threads in BLAS can lead to significantly
{\em worse} performance while using up substantially more computing
resources.

\subsection{GNU/Linux}
\label{section:gnulinux}

GNU/Linux is the development platform for \JAGS, and a variety of
different build options have been explored, including the use of
third-party compilers and linear algebra libraries.

\subsubsection{Fortran compiler}

The GNU FORTRAN compiler changed between gcc 3.x and gcc 4.x from
\code{g77} to \code{gfortran}. Code produced by the two compilers is
binary incompatible. If your BLAS and LAPACK libraries are linked
against \code{libgfortran}, then they were built with \code{gfortran}
and you must also use this to compile \JAGS. 

Most recent GNU/Linux distributions have moved completely to gcc 4.x.
However, some older systems may have both compilers installed.
Unfortunately, if \code{g77} is on your path then the configure script
will find it first, and will attempt to use it to build \JAGS. This
results in a failure to recognize the installed BLAS and LAPACK
libraries. In this event, set the \code{F77} variable at configure time.
\begin{verbatim}
F77=gfortran ./configure
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{BLAS and LAPACK}

The {\bf BLAS} and {\bf LAPACK} libraries from Netlib
(\url{http://www.netlib.org}) should be provided as part of your Linux
distribution. If your Linux distribution splits packages into ``user''
and ``developer'' versions, then you must install the developer
package ({\em e.g.}  \texttt{blas-devel} and \texttt{lapack-devel}).

{\bf Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)} does not include BLAS and
LAPACK in the main distribution. They are included in the SLES SDK, on
a set of CD/DVD images which can be downloaded from the Novell web
site.  See \url{http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/SLES_SDK}
for more information.

It is quite common for the Netlib implementations of BLAS and LAPACK
to break when they are compiled with the latest GNU compilers.  Linux
distributions that use ``bleeding edge'' development tools -- such as
{\bf Fedora} -- may ship with a broken version of BLAS and
LAPACK. Normally, this problem is quickly identified and
fixed. However, you need to take care to use the online updates of the
BLAS and LAPACK packages from your Linux Distributor, and not rely on
the version that came on the installation disk.

\subsubsection{ATLAS}

On Fedora Linux, pre-compiled atlas libraries are available via the
\texttt{atlas} and \texttt{atlas-devel} RPMs.  These RPMs install the
atlas libraries in the non-standard directory \texttt{/usr/lib/atlas}
(or \texttt{/usr/lib64/atlas} for 64-bit builds) to avoid conflicts
with the standard \texttt{blas} and \texttt{lapack} RPMs. To use the
atlas libraries, you must supply their location using the
\code{LDFLAGS} variable (see section \ref{section:blas:lapack})
\begin{verbatim}
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/atlas"
\end{verbatim}
Runtime linking to the correct libraries is ensured by the automatic
addition of \texttt{/usr/lib/atlas} to the linker path (see the directory
\texttt{/etc/ld.so.conf.d}), so you do not need to set the
environment variable \code{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} at run time.

\subsubsection{AMD Core Math Library}
\label{section:acml:linux}

The AMD Core Math Library (acml) provides optimized BLAS and LAPACK
routines for AMD processors. To link \JAGS\ with \texttt{acml}, you must
supply the \texttt{acml} library as the argument to \texttt{--with-blas}.
It is not necessary to set the \texttt{--with-lapack} argument
as \texttt{acml} provides both sets of functions. See also
section~\ref{section:blas:lapack} for run-time instructions.

For example, to link to the 64-bit acml using gcc 4.0+:
\begin{verbatim}
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/acml4.3.0/gfortran64/lib" \
./configure --with-blas="-lacml -lacml_mv" 
\end{verbatim}
The \code{acmv\_mv} library is a vectorized math library that
exists only for the 64-bit version and is omitted when linking against
32-bit acml.

On multi-core systems, you may wish to use the threaded acml library
(See the warning in section \ref{section:blas:multithreaded} however).
To do this, link to \code{acml\_mp} and add the compiler flag
\option{-fopenmp}:
\begin{verbatim}
LDFLAGS="-L/opt/acml4.3.0/gfortran64_mp/lib" \
CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -fopenmp" ./configure --with-blas="-lacml_mp -lacml_mv" 
\end{verbatim}
The number of threads used by multi-threaded acml may be controlled
with the environment variable \code{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS}.

\subsubsection{Intel Math Kernel Library}

The Intel Math Kernel library (MKL) provides optimized BLAS and LAPACK
routines for Intel processors.  MKL is designed to be linked to
executables, not shared libraries. This means that it can only be
linked to a static version of \JAGS, in which the \JAGS\ library and
modules are linked into the main executable. To build a static version
of \JAGS, use the configure option \option{--disable-shared}.

MKL version 10.0 and above uses a ``pure layered'' model for linking.
The layered model gives the user fine-grained control over four
different library layers: interface, threading, computation, and
run-time. Some examples of linking to MKL using this layered model are
given below. These examples are for GCC compilers on
\code{x86\_64}. The choice of interface layer is important on
\code{x86\_64} since the Intel Fortran compiler returns complex values
differently from the GNU Fortran compiler. You must therefore use the
interface layer that matches your compiler (\code{mkl\_intel*} or
\code{mkl\_gf*}).

For further guidance, consult the MKL Link Line advisor at
\url{http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor}.

Recent versions of MKL include a shell script that sets up the
environment variables necessary to build an application with MKL.
\begin{verbatim}
source /opt/intel/composerxe-2011/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64
\end{verbatim}

After calling this script, you can link \JAGS\ with a sequential
version of MKL as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --disable-shared \
  --with-blas="-lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread"
\end{verbatim}
Note that \code{libpthread} is still required, even when linking
to sequential MKL.

Threaded MKL may be used with:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure --disable-shared \
  --with-blas="-lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_gnu_thread -lmkl_core -liomp5 -lpthread"
\end{verbatim}
The default number of threads will be chosen by the OpenMP software,
but can be controlled by setting \code{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS} or
\code{MKL\_NUM\_THREADS}.  (See the warning in section
\ref{section:blas:multithreaded} however).

\subsubsection{Using Intel Compilers}

\JAGS\ has been successfully built with the Intel Composer XE
compilers. To set up the environment for using these compilers call
the \file{compilervars.sh} shell script, {\em e.g.}
\begin{verbatim}
source /opt/intel/composerxe-2011/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
\end{verbatim}
Then call the configure script with the Intel compilers:
\begin{verbatim}
CC=icc CXX=icpc F77=ifort ./configure 
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Using Clang}

\JAGS\ has been built with the clang compiler for C and C++ (version 3.1).
The configuration was
\begin{verbatim}
LD="llvm-ld" CC="clang" CXX="clang++" ./configure
\end{verbatim}
In this configuration, the gfortran compiler was used for Fortran and
the C++ code was linked to the GNU standard C++ library (libstdc++)
rather than the version supplied by the LLVM project (libc++).

\subsection{Solaris}

\JAGS\ has been successfully built and tested on the Intel x86
platform under Solaris 11 using the Sun Studio 12.3 compilers.
\begin{verbatim}
./configure CC=cc CXX=CC F77=f95 \
CFLAGS="-xO3 -xarch=sse2" \
FFLAGS="-xO3 -xarch=sse2" \
CXXFLAGS="-xO3 -xarch=sse2"
\end{verbatim}
The Sun Studio compiler is not optimized by default. Use the option
\option{-xO3} for optimization (NB This is the letter ``O'' not the
number 0) In order to use the optimization flag \option{-xO3} you
must specify the architecture with the \option{-xarch} flag. The options
above are for an Intel processor with SSE2 instructions. This must be
adapted to your own platform.

To compile a 64-bit version of JAGS, add the option \option{-m64} to
all the compiler flags.

Solaris provides two versions of the C++ standard library:
\texttt{libCstd}, which is the default, and \texttt{libstlport4},
which conforms more closely to the C++ standard. \JAGS\ may be linked
to the stlport4 library by adding the option
\option{-library=stlport4} to \code{CXXFLAGS}. 

The configure script automatically detects the Sun Performance library,
which implements the BLAS/LAPACK functions.

\section{Mac OS X}

If trying to build software on Mac OS X you really need to use Leopard
(10.5.x) or Snow Leopard (10.6.x). Unless otherwise stated these
instruction assume Snow Leopard (10.6.x). The open source support has
improved greatly in recent releases. You also need the latest version
of Apple's Xcode development tools. The current version is Xcode 3.2.x
(Leopard uses 3.1.x).  Early versions have serious bugs which affect R
and \JAGS.  Xcode is available as a free download from
\url{http://developer.apple.com}. You need to set up a free login to
ADC. The Apple developer tools do not include a Fortran
compiler. Without Fortran, you will not be able to build \JAGS.

For instructions for building on Tiger or for older versions of
\R\ see previous versions of this manual.

The GNU gfortran Fortran compiler is included in the \R\ binary
distribution available on CRAN. Install the \R\ binary and select all
the optional components in the `Customize' step of the installer.
These instructions assume R-2.7.x.

The default C/C++ compiler for Snow Leopard is gcc-4.2.x. Xcode 3.2
also includes gcc-4.2 and llvm-gcc4.2.  The code has been successfully
built with these optional compilers but will only run on Leopard.
llvm is being actively developed by Apple and may produce better code.

MacOS X 10.2 and onwards include optimised versions of the BLAS and
LAPACK libraries.  So no extra libraries are is needed for Snow
Leopard.  Optimisation continues andApple are working on using GPUs
for this sort of math.  Make sure your OS is up to date.

To ensure the \JAGS\ configure script can find the Fortran compiler
for a bash shell
\begin{verbatim}
export F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
\end{verbatim}

On 64 bit hardware, which means most recent Macs, there may be a 
problem with the Fortran compiler.  Apple's compilers default to 64 bit 
builds on 64 bit hardware but the Fortran binaries available default to 
32 bit builds. This means you need to add compile and link options.

For instance on 64 bit Intel Macs type
\begin{verbatim}
export CFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export CXXFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export FFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export LDFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
\end{verbatim}

Some Fortran compilers (not the ones from CRAN) do not understand 
the -arch option. For these you will need something like:
\begin{verbatim}
export CFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export CXXFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
export FFLAGS='-m64'
export LDFLAGS='-arch x86_64'
\end{verbatim}

To build \JAGS\ unpack the source code and cd into the source  
directory. Type the following:
\begin{verbatim}
./configure
make
\end{verbatim}
(if you have multiple CPUs try \command{make -j 4} or
\command{make -j 8}. It may need to be issued more than once)
\begin{verbatim}
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}

You need to ensure \texttt{/usr/local/bin} is in your PATH in order
for \command{jags} to work from a shell prompt.

This will build the default architecture for you Mac: ppc on a G4 or
G5 and i386 or \code{x86\_64} on an Intel Mac.  If you want to build
multiple architecture fat binaries, you will need to ensure that
libtool in the JAGS sources is version 1.5.24 or later.  Then you can
use configure commands like
\begin{verbatim}
CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" ./configure
\end{verbatim}

Make will then build fat binaries.  See the R Mac developers page 
\url{http://r.research.att.com/} for instructions to build fat R packages.

A final note on MacOS X builds: do NOT use \texttt{-O3}.  It is not optimal 
and may find compiler bugs.  Apple recommends \texttt{-Os}.

\clearpage
\section{Windows}
\label{section:windows}

These instructions use MinGW, the Minimalist GNU system for Windows.
You need some familiarity with Unix in order to follow the build
instructions but, once built, \JAGS\ can be installed on any PC
running windows, where it can be run from the Windows command prompt.

\subsection{Preparing the build environment}

You need to install the following packages
\begin{itemize}
\item The TDM-GCC compiler suite for Windows
\item MSYS  
\item NSIS, including the AccessControl plug-in  
\end{itemize}

We used the TDM-GCC compilers based on the MinGW-w64 project
(\url{http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net}).  This distribution was chosen
because it allows us to build a version of JAGS that is statically
linked against the gcc runtime library.  This, in turn, is necessary
to have a functional rjags package on Windows.  We also tried version
Rtools (\url{http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools}). Although the
resulting JAGS library is functional, it is not compatible with R:
loading the rjags package causes R to crash on exit.

TDM-GCC has a nice installer, available from Sourceforge (follow the
links on the main TDM-GCC web site). Ensure that you download the
MinGW-w64/sjlj version as this is capable of producing both 32-bit and
64-bit binaries.

Select a ``Recommended C/C++'' installation and customize it by
selecting the Fortran compiler, which is not installed by
default. After installation, to force the compiler to use static
linking, delete any import libraries (files ending in \file{.dll.a}
in the TDM-GCC tree.  

MSYS (the Minimal SYStem) is part of the MinGW project. It provides a
bash shell for you to build Unix software. Download the MinGW
installer from \url{http://www.mingw.org}. We used
\file{mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe}.  Run the installer and select
``MSYS Basic System''.  There is no need to install the ``MinGW
Developer Toolkit'' if you are working with a release tarball of
\JAGS.  It is not necessary to install any of the compilers that come
with MinGW as we shall be using the TDM versions. To make MSYS use the
TDM-compilers, edit the file \file{c:/mingw/msys/1.0/etc/fstab}
to read
\begin{verbatim}
c:\MinGW64\    /mingw
\end{verbatim}

MSYS creates a home directory for you in
\file{c:/mingw/msys/1.0/home/username}, where \code{username} is
your user name under Windows. You will need to copy and paste the
source files for LAPACK and JAGS into this directory.

The Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
(\url{http://nsis.sourceforge.net}) allows you to create a
self-extracting executable that installs \JAGS\ on the target PC.
These instructions were tested with NSIS 2.46.  You must also install
the AccessControl plug-in for NSIS, which is available from
\url{http://nsis.sourceforge.net/AccessControl_plug-in}. The plug-in
is distributed as a zip file which is unpacked into the installation
directory of NSIS.

\subsubsection{Building LAPACK}

Download the LAPACK source file from
\url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack} to your MSYS home directory. We
used version 3.4.1.

You need to build LAPACK twice: once for 32-bit \JAGS\ and once for
64-bit \JAGS. The instructions below are for 32-bit \JAGS. To build
64-bit versions, repeat the instructions with the flag \option{-m32}
replaced by \option{-m64} and start in a clean build directory.  Note
that you cannot cross-build 64-bit BLAS and LAPACK on a 32-bit Windows
system. This is because the build process must run some 64-bit test
programs.

Launch MSYS, labelled as ``MinGW shell'' on the Windows Start Menu,
and unpack the tarball.
\begin{verbatim}
tar xfvz lapack-3.4.1.tgz
cd lapack-3.4.1
\end{verbatim}
Copy the file \file{INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran} to \file{make.inc} in
the top level source directory.  Then edit \file{make.inc} replacing
the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
FORTRAN = gfortran -m32
LOADER = gfortran -m32
\end{verbatim}
Type
\begin{verbatim}
make blaslib
make lapacklib 
\end{verbatim}
The compilation process is slow. Eventually, it will create two static
libraries \file{librefblas.a} and \file{liblapack.a}. These are
insufficient for building \JAGS: you need to create dynamic link
library (DLL) for each one.

First create a definition file \file{libblas.def} that exports all the
symbols from the BLAS library
\begin{verbatim}
dlltool -z libblas.def --export-all-symbols librefblas.a
\end{verbatim}
Then link this with the static library to create a DLL
(\file{libblas.dll}) and an import library (\file{libblas.dll.a})
\begin{verbatim}
gcc -m32 -shared -o libblas.dll -Wl,--out-implib=libblas.dll.a \
libblas.def librefblas.a -lgfortran
\end{verbatim}
 
Repeat the same steps for the LAPACK library, creating an import library
(\file{liblapack.dll.a}) and DLL (\file{liblapack.dll})
\begin{verbatim}
dlltool -z liblapack.def --export-all-symbols liblapack.a

gcc -m32 -shared -o liblapack.dll -Wl,--out-implib=liblapack.dll.a \
liblapack.def liblapack.a  -L./ -lblas -lgfortran
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Compiling \JAGS}

Unpack the JAGS source
\begin{verbatim}
tar xfvz JAGS-3.3.0.tar.gz
cd JAGS-3.3.0
\end{verbatim}
and configure JAGS for a 32-bit build
\begin{verbatim}
CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" F77="gfortran -m32" \
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/import/libs/ -Wl,--enable-auto-import" 
\end{verbatim}
where \file{/path/to/import/libs} is a directory that contains the
32-bit import libraries (\file{libblas.dll.a} and
\file{liblapack.dll.a}).  This must be an {\em absolute} path name,
and not relative to the JAGS build directory.

After the configure step, type
\begin{verbatim}
make win32-install
\end{verbatim}
This will install JAGS into the subdirectory \file{win/inst32}.
Note that you must go straight from the configure step to \texttt{make
  win32-install} without the usual step of typing \texttt{make} on
its own.  The \texttt{win32-install} target resets the installation
prefix, and this will cause an error if the source is already
compiled.

To install the 64-bit version, clean the build directory 
\begin{verbatim}
make clean 
\end{verbatim}
reconfigure JAGS for a 64-bit build:
\begin{verbatim}
CC="gcc -m64" CXX="g++ -m64" F77="gfortran -m64" \
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/import/libs/ -Wl,--enable-auto-import" 
\end{verbatim}
Then type
\begin{verbatim}
make win64-install
\end{verbatim}
This will install JAGS into the subdirectory \file{win/inst64}.

With both 32-bit and 64-bit installations in place you can create the
installer.  Normally you will want to distribute the blas and lapack
libraries with JAGS.  In this case, put the 32-bit DLLs and import
libraries in the sub-directory \file{win/runtime32} and the 64-bit
DLLs and import libraries in the sub-directory
\file{win/runtime64}. They will be detected and included with the
distribution.

Make sure that the file \file{makensis.exe}, provided by
NSIS, is in your PATH. For a typical installation of NSIS, on 32-bit
windows:
\begin{verbatim}
PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ files/NSIS
\end{verbatim}
Then type
\begin{verbatim}
make installer
\end{verbatim}
After the build process finishes, the self extracting archive will be
in the subdirectory \file{win}.

\end{document}
