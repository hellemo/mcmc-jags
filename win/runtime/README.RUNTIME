If you wish to distribute runtime libraries with the JAGS installer,
put the DLLs (*.dll) and, if required, the import libraries (*.dll.a)
in this subdirectory of the build tree.  They will be detected and
included in the installation.

As of JAGS 3.0, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of JAGS are included
in the same installer.  32-bit DLLs should go in a sub-directory "i386"
and 64-bit DLLs in "x64".
